        <p>
          During my experience working on enterprise telecom applications, I
          applied modern DevOps practices by containerizing applications with
          Docker and setting up automated CI/CD pipelines using GitLab CI/CD.
          This greatly streamlined deployment and testing processes, reducing
          manual work and improving release efficiency.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the backend side, I developed and maintained APIs using Python and
          FastAPI. These APIs supported critical enterprise functions such as
          data processing, reporting services, and internal system integrations.
          A key part of this work involved ensuring that the services were
          secure, reliable, and production-ready, allowing the business to
          confidently scale its systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also contributed to database design and query optimization with
          PostgreSQL, where I improved data access speed and system reliability.
          This work involved analyzing query performance and working with senior
          engineers to refine schema design.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond coding, I actively participated in the software development
          lifecycle by collaborating with senior engineers on system design,
          testing new features, and engaging in peer code reviews. These reviews
          not only improved the overall quality of the platform but also gave me
          valuable exposure to professional engineering standards.
        </p>

        <p>
          Collaboration was a central part of this role â€” I worked closely with
          developers, QA engineers, and business analysts to resolve issues,
          align on requirements, and ensure that deliverables met both technical
          and business needs. Through this teamwork, I strengthened my
          communication and problem-solving skills in a professional
          environment.
